# Canonical Involution Benchmarks

This repository contains all source code used to reproduce the computational
benchmarks reported in Table 2 of the article:

**“Canonical Involution and Integrability in Higher-Order Differential Systems”**  
(Manuscript submitted, 2025)

## 🔍 Overview

This project implements:

- the canonical involution \( \alpha^{(k)}_\theta \)
- prolongation of differential systems
- discrepancy computation
- automated integrability checks
- reproducible benchmarks

All experiments in the paper can be reproduced using the Python scripts in `src/`
and the Jupyter notebooks in `examples/`.
