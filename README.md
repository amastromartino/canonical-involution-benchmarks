# Canonical Involution Benchmarks

A Python package implementing the α_θ^(k) method for canonical involution verification with reproducible benchmark results.

## Features

- Implementation of the α_θ^(k) method for efficient integrability verification
- Comparison with traditional Cartan-Kähler approach
- Benchmark scripts to reproduce Table 2 from the paper
- Example systems for testing (involutive and non-involutive)
- Integration with SymPy for symbolic computation

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amastromartino/canonical-involution-benchmarks.git
   cd canonical-involution-benchmarks
