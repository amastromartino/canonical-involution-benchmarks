# Canonical Involution Benchmarks

A Python package implementing the alpha-theta method for canonical involution verification with reproducible benchmark results.

## Features

- Implementation of the alpha-theta method for efficient integrability verification
- Comparison with traditional Cartan-Kähler approach
- Benchmark scripts to reproduce Table 2 from the paper
- Example systems for testing (involutive and non-involutive)
- Integration with SymPy for symbolic computation

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/amastromartino/canonical-involution-benchmarks.git
cd canonical-involution-benchmarks
