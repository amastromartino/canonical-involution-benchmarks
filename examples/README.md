# Examples: Involution Checking for Differential Systems

This folder contains minimal, self-contained examples that demonstrate how to use  
the function `check_involution_condition()` from the main package.

Each example can be executed directly and is intended to show:

- A **system that *is* involutive**  
- A **system that is *not* involutive**

These allow reviewers to verify correctness, reproducibility, and clarity of the code.
