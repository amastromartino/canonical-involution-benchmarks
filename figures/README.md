# Figures Directory

This directory contains figures, diagrams, and visual materials associated with the project **Canonical Involution Benchmarks**.

### Purpose
Figures stored here support:
- Explanations of the prolongation operator  
- Visual interpretation of canonical involution  
- Jet bundle diagrams  
- Flowcharts of the integrability pipeline  
- Any illustrations used in notebooks or documentation  

### Notes
- Images should be in `.png`, `.svg`, or `.pdf` format.
- Filenames must be descriptive (e.g., `jet_space_diagram.png`, `pipeline_overview.svg`).
- Large binary files should not exceed GitHub's recommended size (prefer < 5 MB).
